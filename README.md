# Conduct-DiD-fixed-effect-models-and-propensity-matching-to-analyze-the-impact-of-the-Volcker-Rule
The Volcker Rule was announced to restrict banks from conducting certain investment activities with their own account in order to decrease risks taken by the bank, and hence to have a greater stability. Due to the restrictions, banks might argue that their profitability has decreased and therefore, assumption was made to analyze the impact of the Volcker Rule. In this project, we used the Difference-in-difference (DiD) models, including the baseline DiD model and the robust DiD models that considered the heterogeneity of different time points and individual bank holding companies by adding the fixed effect technique. In addition, we also conducted a propensity match to compare the post Volcker Rule results with the most similar results before the announcement of the Volcker Rule.
